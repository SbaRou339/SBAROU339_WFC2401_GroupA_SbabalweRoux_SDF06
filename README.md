# Learning Reflections README 

## **6.15 CodeSpace Pets Instagram Profile Project**

### Overview

In this project I have created a simple instagram page for both desktop view and mobile view.

### Reflections

This project was a bit hard because I started late so, I had to catch up on a lot of things and that made everything even worse. I hope to work more and more on the project and the concepts themselves.

#### Areas of Mastery

- **CSS Layout Techniques**: Implemented some layouts and grid for better funtioning but there is still some polishing to do on the layout module as a whole but we will get there.
- **Responsive Design**: Succesfully implemented media queries to ensure the page looks good.
- **Styling Elements**: I was able to style the profile image, user information, and gallery section effectively, closely resembling an Instagram profile.


#### Challenges Faced

- **Responsive Design for Smaller Screens**: the design is the same for both desktop view and mobile view.
- **Hover and Focus Effects**: Played around with these functions on pictures and the adit button function.

#### Areas for Improvement

- **Advanced CSS Properties**: I hope to learn more and more on css properties.
- **Code Optimization**: I can improve the project both for reliability, efficiency and  better look.
- **Creative Design Choices**: Decided to change the look from not just being plain white but have different colors.

#### Overall Learning Experience

I have had a great learning experience and I hope to have more.
